# Architecture

## Overview

Roger is a single-process Rust async application using `matrix-sdk` (tokio-based). It syncs with a Matrix homeserver, listens for messages in allowlisted rooms, and responds via LLM.

## Config system

Two-file design keeps secrets off GitHub:

- `config/profiles.toml` — committed. Defines named LLM profiles (`chat`, `fast`, `code`, etc.) and routing rules. References backends by logical name, not URL.
- `config/backends.<HOST_ROLE>.toml` — **gitignored**. Maps logical backend names to real URLs, models, and `api_key_env` variable names. `HOST_ROLE` env var selects which file to load (default: `local`).

API keys are never in config files — only the *name* of the env var holding them.

## Session persistence

On first login, roger saves `roger_session/session.json` (access_token, device_id, user_id). On restart, it restores from this file instead of re-logging in. This prevents a new device ID on every restart, which would conflict with the SQLite E2EE crypto store.

## Conversation history

`HistoryStore` writes one JSON file per room to `roger_session/history/`. Room IDs are sanitized for filesystem safety. Context window is the last 20 messages, passed as the full messages array to the LLM.

History is room-scoped by default. No cross-room sharing (each room has independent context).

## Response UX

For every response:
1. `room.typing_notice(true)` — shows the typing indicator in Matrix clients
2. Send "Working on it…" immediately — user sees activity before LLM responds
3. Call LLM with room history
4. Edit the ack message in-place via `m.replace` (ruma `ReplacementMetadata`) — no extra messages accumulate
5. `room.typing_notice(false)`

## Audio pipeline

1. Matrix sends an `m.audio` event with encrypted media
2. `matrix_sdk::media` downloads and decrypts via `MediaRequestParameters`
3. Raw bytes POST'd to Speaches (`/v1/audio/transcriptions`, model `Systran/faster-whisper-small`)
4. Transcript text fed into normal LLM flow

## LiteLLM proxy

All cloud LLM calls go through a LiteLLM Docker container on `srv:4000`. This:
- Keeps the Anthropic API key on one machine (`srv`) only
- The `ai` machine uses a LiteLLM virtual key (`GATEWAY_VKEY`) with no direct Anthropic access
- Lets backends be swapped without changing roger's config

## Profile routing

`ReloadableState` holds one `LlmClient` per profile (`llms: HashMap<profile, client>`),
built from `profiles.toml` at startup and on reload. A profile that fails to build
(e.g. its backend is missing on this host) is skipped with a warning; `chat` is
required.

Each room resolves to a profile via `ReloadableState::llm_for_room`:
1. a runtime `/model` override (`room_profiles`), else
2. the room's `profile` config field, else
3. `chat`.

If the resolved profile has no built client, it falls back to `chat`. The resolved
profile + model are shown in `/status`.

Runtime `/model` overrides are persisted to `roger_session/room_profiles.json`
(`RoomProfileStore`) and reloaded on startup; overrides for profiles that don't
build on this host are dropped on load and on reload.

## Config hot-reload

Reloadable config lives behind `Arc<RwLock<ReloadableState>>` (in `matrix/handler.rs`),
shared by every event handler via the cloned `BotCtx`. `ReloadableState` holds the
LLM client, model name, global system prompt, and per-room configs.

A `SIGHUP` listener task (`reload_on_sighup` in `main.rs`) re-reads `config/` and
swaps the state in place. Reload is fail-safe: a bad config logs a warning and the
running config is kept. Handlers clone what they need out of the lock and release it
before any LLM/network call, so reloads never block in-flight requests.

Fixed for the process lifetime (restart required): Matrix credentials, homeserver,
room allowlist, the logging setup, and the speaches client.

## Logging

`init_logging` builds a layered `tracing` subscriber:
- **stderr** — human-readable, captured by journald under systemd.
- **file** — JSON lines, daily-rotated via `tracing-appender` into `ROGER_LOG_DIR`
  (default `roger_session/logs/`).

A single `EnvFilter` (`RUST_LOG`) gates both sinks. The non-blocking writer's
`WorkerGuard` is held in `main` so buffered logs flush at shutdown.

## Backend kinds

- `open-ai` — standard OpenAI-compatible REST API (LM Studio, Ollama, LiteLLM)
- `claude-code` — reserved for spawning `claude -p` subprocess (not yet implemented)
- `open-code` — reserved for `opencode run` subprocess (future)
